# Introduction

We are excited to introduce Qwen-Image-Edit-2511, an enhanced version over Qwen-Image-Edit-2509, featuring multiple improvements—including notably better consistency. To try out the latest model, please visit [Qwen Chat](https://chat.qwen.ai/?inputFeature=image_edit) and select the Image Editing feature.

Key enhancements in Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 include: mitigate image drift, improved character consistency，integrated LoRA capabilities， enhanced industrial design generation, and strengthened geometric reasoning ability.


## Quick Start

Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use `Qwen-Image-Edit-2511`:

```python
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2511", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print("pipeline loaded")

pipeline.to('cuda')
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open("input1.png")
image2 = Image.open("input2.png")
prompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."
inputs = {
    "image": [image1, image2],
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 40,
    "guidance_scale": 1.0,
    "num_images_per_prompt": 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit_2511.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_2511.png"))

```

## Showcase

**Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 Enhances Character Consistency**
In Qwen-Image-Edit-2511, character consistency has been significantly improved. The model can perform imaginative edits based on an input portrait while preserving the identity and visual characteristics of the subject.

**Improved Multi-Person Consistency**
While Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 already improved consistency for single-subject editing, Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 further enhances consistency in multi-person group photos—enabling high-fidelity fusion of two separate person images into a coherent group shot:

**Built-in Support for Community-Created LoRAs**
Since Qwen-Image-Edit’s release, the community has developed many creative and high-quality LoRAs—greatly expanding its expressive potential. Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 integrates selected popular LoRAs directly into the base model, unlocking their effects without extra tuning.

For example, Lighting Enhancement LoRA
Realistic lighting control is now achievable out-of-the-box:

Another example, generating new viewpoints can now be done directly with the base model:

**Enhanced Geometric Reasoning**
Qwen-Image-Edit-2511 introduces stronger geometric reasoning capability—e.g., directly generating auxiliary construction lines for design or annotation purposes:
